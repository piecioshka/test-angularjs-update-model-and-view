# test-angularjs-update-model-and-view

Check which layer will be updated faster.

## Motivation

My tests said that `model` is first updated, next `view`.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    
2. Open `app/index.html` in browser
3. Open `DevTools` and switch to `Console` tab
4. Type somethin into a input in the app
5. Observe results in DevTools Console
